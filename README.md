# OpenEMR API Testing Suite using Spring Boot and Retrofit
## Overview
Console based REST API Endpoint Testing tool for OpenEMR API using Spring boot and Retrofit2
This console based REST API Endpoint Testing tool helps in understanding the behaviour and output of the data being parsed through an endpoint of the OpenEMR REST API.
This tool will be beneficial for developers creating Mobile Apps that use Retrofit for API interactions and Web Apps that use Spring Boot
This will have Testing tools made with Retrofit Controllers and Spring Boot separately as two directories named as such which at this time cannot be run a single project but as two different ones in the local system
